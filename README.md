# CPP Game

Learning c++ while making a game with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

## Project Structure

You need to add the SDL2 files (.dll, include and lib) yourself (maybe i will add them to a github release). 
```
mainFolder
- include
  - SDL2
- lib
- src
.gitgnore
Makefile
SDL2.dll
```
